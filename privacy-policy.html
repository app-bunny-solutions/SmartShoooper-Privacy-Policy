        <h2>1. Summary</h2>
        <p>Smart Shopper helps users create and manage shopping lists, track purchases, receive reminders, and discover relevant product suggestions. This policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, and the choices you have.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect three categories of information: (A) information you provide directly, (B) information collected automatically, and (C) aggregated or derived information.</p>

        <h3>A. Information you provide</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account details:</strong> If you choose to create an account, we may collect your name, email address, and a password.</li>
          <li><strong>Shopping data:</strong> the shopping lists, items, quantities, categories, notes, and any photos or attachments you add to lists.</li>
          <li><strong>Purchase history:</strong> purchases you record in the App (amounts, dates, payment mode, vendor name) and optional receipts you attach.</li>
          <li><strong>Communications:</strong> messages you send to support or feedback forms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>B. Information collected automatically</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Device & usage data:</strong> device model, OS version, app version, crash logs, and how you interact with the App (pages visited, features used).</li>
          <li><strong>Identifiers for advertising & analytics:</strong> advertising IDs (Google Advertising ID / IDFA) and anonymized identifiers for analytics providers when enabled.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance metrics:</strong> anonymized timing, speed and error reports collected to improve the App.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>C. Derived and aggregated information</h3>
        <p>We may aggregate or analyze data (for example: most popular grocery items across users) and use it in non-identifying ways to improve the App and services.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To provide and operate the App (save your shopping lists and purchase history).</li>
          <li>To personalize content and suggestions (e.g., frequently purchased items, category suggestions).</li>
          <li>To send optional reminders and push notifications (low-stock alerts, shopping reminders) when you opt in.</li>
          <li>To process in-app purchases or subscription billing via app stores (Apple App Store / Google Play).</li>
          <li>To detect and fix technical issues and improve performance.</li>
          <li>To comply with legal obligations or respond to lawful requests by public authorities.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> trusted third-party vendors who perform services on our behalf (cloud hosting, analytics, crash reporting, email delivery, payment processing). They only receive the data needed to perform their services and are contractually bound to protect your information.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal requests:</strong> if required by law or to comply with a valid legal process, or to protect rights, safety, or property.</li>
          <li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> in connection with a merger, acquisition, sale of assets, or bankruptcy, user data may be transferred as part of the transaction (with notice where required by law).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. In-App Advertising & Analytics</h2>
        <p>Smart Shopper may display advertising and uses analytics tools to understand usage patterns. These third parties may collect information about your device and interactions to provide interest-based ads or analytics. Advertising identifiers (such as Google Advertising ID or IDFA) may be used for ad personalization. You can limit ad tracking or reset advertising identifiers via your device settings.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Cookies & Local Storage</h2>
        <p>As a mobile app, Smart Shopper stores data locally on your device (preferences, cached lists) and may use cookies or similar local mechanisms in any web views. Clearing the app data will remove locally stored content unless you have synced it to a cloud account (if account sync is available).</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the App, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce agreements, and for internal analytics. If you delete your account, we will delete or anonymize your personal data within a reasonable timeframe, except where retention is required by law.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>8. Your Rights & Choices</h2>

        <h2>9. Security</h2>
        <p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Examples include encrypted communication (TLS) and access controls. However, no system is 100% secure — please take care when choosing what to store in the App.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>10. Children</h2>
        <p>Smart Shopper is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without parental consent. If you believe we have collected data from a child under 13, please contact us and we will promptly delete the information as required by law.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>11. International Transfers</h2>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>12. Third-Party Links & Services</h2>
        <p>The App may link to third-party websites, services, or SDKs (for payments, mapping, or ads). We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties. Please read the privacy policies of those services before providing information.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>13. Payments & Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>If the App offers in-app purchases or subscriptions, billing and payment are handled by Apple App Store or Google Play. We do not have access to your payment credentials. Subscription terms, renewals, and refunds are governed by the store where you purchased the subscription.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>14. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy with a revised effective date. If changes are material, we will provide a more prominent notice (such as in-app notification).</p>
      </section>

        <h2>18. How to Delete or Export Your Data</h2>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>19. Miscellaneous</h2>
        <p>If a provision in this Privacy Policy is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in effect. This policy is governed by law of the jurisdiction where the App owner is domiciled, unless otherwise required by local law.</p>
